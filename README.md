TUCSON CAR COLLISION ANALYSIS:

Final project repo for INFO 526 - Spring 2024.

INTRODUCTION:

The focus of this project is to develop a user-friendly, interactive dashboard that provides the user detailed insights into the frequency, severity, and causes of traffic accidents in Tucson.

DATA SET:

We utilize the GIS Data from the City of Tucson, which includes publicly-available records of car crashes from the Tucson Police Department from the years 2018 through 2023.

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

Our goal is to develop a user-friendly dashboard using Quarto that enables users to explore and gain insights from the accident data based on various criteria such as time period and accident severity. The four main steps to accomplish this objective are:

1. Implement Leaflet to incorporate interactive maps within the dashboard.

2. Display clustered accident data and allow users to identify accident hotspots within Tucson using latitude and longitude coordinates from the dataset.
 
3. Utilize ggplot2 and Plotly to create both dynamic and static visualizations within the dashboard.
 
4. Adjust visualizations based on user preferences and criteria, enhancing the user's ability to understand and analyze the accident data effectively.
