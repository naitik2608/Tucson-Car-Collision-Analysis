## 📌 Introduction

This project delivers an interactive and visually rich dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into traffic collisions in Tucson, AZ. The dashboard is crafted with **Quarto**, using **ggplot2**, **Plotly**, and **Leaflet** for layered data interaction and geographical mapping.

---

## 📂 Dataset

We used public GIS records from the **City of Tucson**, covering traffic collision data from **2018 to 2023** as reported by the Tucson Police Department. The dataset includes:
- Collision type
- Injury & fatality counts
- Violation categories
- Latitude and longitude for spatial mapping

---

## 🎯 Objectives

The primary goal is to provide a **user-friendly analytical dashboard** for understanding accident patterns based on:
- Time (year/month/day/hour)
- Severity (injury/fatality)
- Location (division/ward/neighborhood)
- Causes (speeding, DUI, distracted driving, etc.)

### Key Features:
✅ Interactive map with **Leaflet**  
✅ Clustered accident points using **lat/lon**  
✅ Time-series and violation analysis using **ggplot2**  
✅ Animated and static charts with **Plotly**  
✅ Dynamic tab structure for modular insights
